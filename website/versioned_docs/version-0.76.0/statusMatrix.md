Efficiently get the status of multiple files at once.

| param           | type [= default]                    | description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| core            | string = 'default'                  | The plugin core identifier to use for plugin injection                                                                                   |
| fs [deprecated] | FileSystem                          | The filesystem containing the git repo. Overrides the fs provided by the [plugin system](./plugin_fs.md).                                |
| **dir**         | string                              | The [working tree](dir-vs-gitdir.md) directory path                                                                                      |
| **gitdir**      | string = join(dir, '.git')          | The [git directory](dir-vs-gitdir.md) path                                                                                               |
| ref             | string = 'HEAD'                     | Optionally specify a different commit to compare against the workdir and stage instead of the HEAD                                       |

| pattern         | string = null                       | Filter the results to only those whose filepath matches a glob pattern. (Pattern is relative to `filepaths` if `filepaths` is provided.) |
| noSubmodules    | boolean = false                     | If true, will skip over submodules completely                                                                                            |
| return          | Promise\<Array\<Array\<number\>\>\> | Resolves with a status matrix, described below.                                                                                          |

The returned `StatusMatrix` is admittedly not the easiest format to read.
However it conveys a large amount of information in dense format that should make it easy to create reports about the current state of the repository;
without having to do multiple, time-consuming isomorphic-git calls.
My hope is that the speed and flexibility of the function will make up for the learning curve of interpreting the return value.

```js live
// get the status of all the files in 'src'
let status = await git.statusMatrix({ dir: '$input((/))', pattern: '$input((src/**))' })
console.log(status)
```

```js live
// get the status of all the JSON and Markdown files
let status = await git.statusMatrix({ dir: '$input((/))', pattern: '$input((**\/*.{json,md}))' })
console.log(status)
```

The result is returned as a 2D array.
The outer array represents the files and/or blobs in the repo, in alphabetical order.
The inner arrays describe the status of the file:
the first value is the filepath, and the next three are integers
representing the HEAD status, WORKDIR status, and STAGE status of the entry.

```js
// example StatusMatrix
[
  ["a.txt", 0, 2, 0], // new, untracked
  ["b.txt", 0, 2, 2], // added, staged
  ["c.txt", 0, 2, 3], // added, staged, with unstaged changes
  ["d.txt", 1, 1, 1], // unmodified
  ["e.txt", 1, 2, 1], // modified, unstaged
  ["f.txt", 1, 2, 2], // modified, staged
  ["g.txt", 1, 2, 3], // modified, staged, with unstaged changes
  ["h.txt", 1, 0, 1], // deleted, unstaged
  ["i.txt", 1, 0, 0], // deleted, staged
]
```

- The HEAD status is either absent (0) or present (1).
- The WORKDIR status is either absent (0), identical to HEAD (1), or different from HEAD (2).
- The STAGE status is either absent (0), identical to HEAD (1), identical to WORKDIR (2), or different from WORKDIR (3).

```ts
type Filename      = string
type HeadStatus    = 0 | 1
type WorkdirStatus = 0 | 1 | 2
type StageStatus   = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3

type StatusRow     = [Filename, HeadStatus, WorkdirStatus, StageStatus]

type StatusMatrix  = StatusRow[]
```

> Think of the natural progression of file modifications as being from HEAD (previous) -> WORKDIR (current) -> STAGE (next).
> Then HEAD is "version 1", WORKDIR is "version 2", and STAGE is "version 3".
> Then, imagine a "version 0" which is before the file was created.
> Then the status value in each column corresponds to the oldest version of the file it is identical to.
> (For a file to be identical to "version 0" means the file is deleted.)

Here are some examples of queries you can answer using the result:

#### Q: What files have been deleted?
```js
const FILE = 0, WORKDIR = 2

const filenames = (await statusMatrix({ dir }))
  .filter(row => row[WORKDIR] === 0)
  .map(row => row[FILE])
```

#### Q: What files have unstaged changes?
```js
const FILE = 0, WORKDIR = 2, STAGE = 3

const filenames = (await statusMatrix({ dir }))
  .filter(row => row[WORKDIR] !== row[STAGE])
  .map(row => row[FILE])
```

#### Q: What files have been modified since the last commit?
```js
const FILE = 0, HEAD = 1, WORKDIR = 2

const filenames = (await statusMatrix({ dir }))
  .filter(row => row[HEAD] !== row[WORKDIR])
  .map(row => row[FILE])
```

#### Q: What files will NOT be changed if I commit right now?
```js
const FILE = 0, HEAD = 1, STAGE = 3

const filenames = (await statusMatrix({ dir }))
  .filter(row => row[HEAD] === row[STAGE])
  .map(row => row[FILE])
```

For reference, here are all possible combinations:

| HEAD | WORKDIR | STAGE | `git status --short` equivalent |
