> **Deprecated**
> This command will be removed in the 1.0.0 version of `isomorphic-git` as it is no longer necessary.
>
> Previously, to sign commits you needed two steps, `commit` and then `sign`.
> Now commits can be signed when they are created with the [`commit`](./commit.md) command, provided you use a [`pgp`](./plugin_pgp.md) plugin.

<aside>
OpenPGP.js is unfortunately licensed under an incompatible license and thus cannot be included in a minified bundle with
isomorphic-git which is an MIT/BSD style library, because that would violate the "dynamically linked" stipulation.
To use this feature you include openpgp with a separate script tag and pass it in as an argument.
</aside>

It creates a signed version of whatever commit HEAD currently points to, and then updates the current branch,
leaving the original commit dangling.

The `privateKeys` argument is a single string in ASCII armor format. However, it is plural "keys" because
you can technically have multiple private keys in a single ASCII armor string. The openpgp.sign() function accepts
multiple keys, so while I haven't tested it, it should support signing a single commit with multiple keys.

Example Code:

```js live
let sha = await git.sign({
  dir: '$input((/))',
  openpgp,
  privateKeys: `$textarea((
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
...
))`
})
console.log(sha)
```
