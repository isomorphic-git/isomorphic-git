title: isomorphic-git.org, corporate sponsors, and a new CORS proxy!
---

We have a new home on the web! Instead of `isomorphic-git.github.io` we now live at `isomorphic-git.org`. This change happened mostly because we needed our own domain name for&hellip;

&hellip;our new CORS proxy! 

> https://cors.isomorphic-git.org &mdash; sponsored by [<img height="50" style="vertical-align: middle; padding-left: 1em" src="https://www.clever-cloud.com/images/brand-assets/logos/clever-cloud-red.svg" alt="Clever Cloud">](https://www.clever-cloud.com/?utm_source=ref&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=isomorphic-git)

After hearing about our bandwidth billing [misadventures](/blog/2018/07/05/cors-proxy-disabled)
with the previous CORS proxy, [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/?utm_source=ref&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=isomorphic-git)
graciously stepped up to sponsor a CORS proxy for isomorphic-git users.
Thanks to their extremely intuitive Platform As A Service (PAAS), it literally
took less than 5 minutes from sign up to have an auto-scaling instance of [`@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy`](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/cors-proxy) deployed.
Thank you Clever Cloud for supporting open source and supporting isomorphic-git in particular!

As of today, you should be able to use `https://cors.isomorphic-git.org` as a CORS proxy for your own
isomorphic-git projects, wherever they are hosted.
