# A Lot of Code Cleanup and Updates
Switched to monorepo all indipendent still useable repos got merged into the main monorepo https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/packages/*

Added ESM Only Builds if you need umd you can create it in your existing pipeline that requires and creates your existing UMD modules.
we supply method that you can execute via "npx rollup -c node_modules/isomorphic-git/rollup.config.umd.js -d ./isomorphic-git.umd.js

## Braking changes
- Does not ship cjs or umd codes only clean esm that is target modele-sync compatible so can be used by require and import but supplys umd and cjs build instructions via npx rollup
- refactored individual repos to monorepo on github.com to make maintainance more simple and allow better community support.
