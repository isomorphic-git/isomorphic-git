title: 'emitter' plugin
sidebar_label: emitter
---

You opt to initialize `isomorphic-git` with a EventEmitter so you can receive `'message'` and `'progress'` events.
The [`clone`](./clone.md), [`fetch`](./fetch.md), [`push`](./push.md), and [`pull`](./pull.md) commands all emit events.

<table>
<tr><th> event </th><th> type </th><th> description </th></tr>
<tr><td> message </td><td> string </td><td>

`'message'` events are for messages generated by the remote server and sent during `fetch` and `push` requests.
They are particularly useful if the remote server has custom git-hooks that print to the console.

</td></tr>
<tr><td> progress </td>
<td>

[ProgressEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ProgressEvent)

</td>
<td>

`'progress'` events are numerical events that could be used to drive progress bar-style animations.

> Note: `'progress'` events are not guaranteed to be in order or always incrementing.
Many git commands (like `clone`) actually consist of multiple sub-commands (`fetch` + `indexPack` + `checkout`) which
makes computing a single progress percentage tricky.
This will be solved one day by providing new fine-grained progress events that more accurately represent the different phases
of complex tasks.

> Note: only one `emitter` plugin can be registered at a time.


## Usage Example 1:

You are writing a console application, and you want to simply print any server messages to standard out.

```js
// This example is for Node.js
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const git = require('isomorphic-git')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()
git.plugins.set('emitter', emitter)

emitter.on('message', message => {
  console.log(message)
})
```

## Usage Example 2:

You are writing a web application, and want to display both the latest message and a progress bar.
In the real world, you would probably be using the latest JS framework like React or Vue, but for this example
I will stick with the DOM API.

> Note: This is not a working example. It focuses only on the parts related to the emitter plugin.

```html
<html>
  <div id="cloning-message"></div>
  <div>
    <span id="cloning-percent"></span>
    <progress id="cloning-progress-bar" value="0" max="100"/>
  </div>
  <script type="module">
    // Note: Webpack automatically polyfills Node's builtin `events` module
    //       with the npm module https://www.npmjs.com/package/events
    import EventEmitter from 'events'
    import { plugins, clone } from 'isomorphic-git'
    plugins.set('emitter', emitter)

    // (In a working example you would also have to set up an 'fs' plugin.)

    const doClone = async () => {
      const onMessage = message => {
        let el = document.getElementById('cloning-message')
        el.innerText = message
      }
      const onProgress = progress => {
        let el = document.getElementById('cloning-progress-bar')
        el.setAttribute('max', progress.total)
        el.setAttribute('value', progress.loaded)
        let span = document.getElementById('cloning-percent')
        span.innerText = Math.floor(100 * progress.loaded / progress.total) + '%'
      }
      emitter.on('message', onMessage)
      emitter.on('progress', onProgress)

      // (In a working example you'd fill in the clone command arguments)
      await clone({...})

      emitter.off('message', onMessage)
      emitter.off('progress', onProgress)
    }
  </script>
</html>
```

### Implementing your own `emitter` plugin

Isomorphic-git does not listen to events, it only emits them.
So your `emitter` object technically only needs to implement the `emit` method.

```ts
interface GitEmitterPlugin {
  emit (event: string, data: any): void;
}
```

> Note: This means you could rewrite the first example like this if you wanted:
>
>  ```js
>  const git = require('isomorphic-git')
>  // No need to use a full EventEmitter object here!
>  const emitter = {
>    emit (event, message) {
>      if (event === 'message') {
>        console.log(message)
>      }
>    }
>  }
>  git.plugins.set('emitter', emitter)
>  ```
